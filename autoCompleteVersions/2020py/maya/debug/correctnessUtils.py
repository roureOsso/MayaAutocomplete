"""
It is meant to be used by tests validating the correctness of evaluation, for
instance validating the correctness of evaluation under evaluation manager or
background evaluation.

Its main utility function is run_correctness_test().

If results_path is set then the graph output and differences are dumped to
files using that path as the base name.  For example:

    results_path            = MyDirectory/emCorrecteness_animCone
    reference results dump  = MyDirectory/emCorrecteness_animCone.ref.txt
    reference results image = MyDirectory/emCorrecteness_animCone.ref.png
    ${mode} results dump    = MyDirectory/emCorrecteness_animCone.${mode}.txt
    ${mode} results image   = MyDirectory/emCorrecteness_animCone.${mode}.png

If results_path is not set then no output is stored, everything is live.

The return value is a list of value pairs indicating number of differences
between the reference evaluation and the tested mode. e.g. if you requested 'ems'
mode then you would get back {'ems' : (0, 0, 0)} from a successful comparison.

If file_name is not set then the current scene is analyzed.
