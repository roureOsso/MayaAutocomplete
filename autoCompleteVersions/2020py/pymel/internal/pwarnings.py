    Decorates a function so that it prints a deprecation warning when called.
    
    The decorator can either receive parameters or the function directly.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    funcOrMessage : Union[str, Callable[..., Any], None]
        If passed a message, the message will be appended to the standard
        deprecation warning and should serve to further clarify why the function
        is being deprecated and/or suggest an alternative function. In this
        case, the return result of this function is another decorator (with the
        ammended message), which then needs to be fed the function to be
        decorated. Otherwise, funcOrMessage should be the func to be decorated,
        and the return result is decorated version of funcOrMessage
    className : Union[str, False, None]
        If given as a str, then the decorated function is asssumed to be method,
        and the name is printed as "module.className.funcName".  If False, it
        is assumed to NOT be a method, and the name is printed as
        "module.funcName".  If None, then the decorator will try to
        automatically determine whether the passed function is a method, and if
        so, what it's className is.
    baseMessage : Optional[str]
        Message which will be combined with the optional message (in
        funcOrMessage) to form the final message. Maybe set to None to ensure
        only the message (in funcOrMessage) is printed.
    warningType : Type[Warning]
        Warning class to raise. Note that DeprecationWarning is ignored by
        default.
